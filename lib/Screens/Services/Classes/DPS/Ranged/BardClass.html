        <h2>Bard Classes</h2>
        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/Classes/DPS/Ranged/BardPicture.png" alt="Bard picture">
        <p>Bard is a versatile ranged DPS class that excels in providing support to the party through 
            various buffs and debuffs. The Bard's primary role is to deal damage while enhancing the 
            performance of their allies with songs that increase critical hit rates, direct hit rates,
            and reduce damage taken. The Bard's gameplay revolves around maintaining damage over time 
            effects (DoTs) on enemies, using their repertoire of songs to provide continuous buffs, and 
            executing powerful burst damage abilities during specific windows of opportunity. The Bard's 
            toolkit includes a variety of abilities that can be used to adapt to different combat situations,
            making them a valuable asset in both solo and group content. One of the Bard's key mechanics is 
            the use of songs such as "Mage's Ballad," "Army's Paeon," and "The Wanderer's Minuet." Each song 
            provides unique benefits and can be cycled through to maximize the party's overall performance. 
            Additionally, the Bard has access to a range of utility abilities, including "Battle Voice," which 
            further enhances the party's damage output, and "Troubadour," which provides defensive buffs.
            The Bard's mobility is another significant advantage, allowing them to maintain high damage output 
            while avoiding enemy attacks. This makes them particularly effective in encounters that require constant 
            movement. Overall, the Bard is a dynamic and engaging class that offers a blend of damage dealing and support 
            capabilities, making them a popular choice among players who enjoy a multifaceted playstyle.
