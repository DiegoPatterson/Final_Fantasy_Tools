                <h3>Astrologian</h3>
                <p>Astrologian is a healer with a lot of utility to help it's team in more than just healing. 
                    With its card system, it can buff its team and ensure that the fight does not go on for too long.
                    With a large rotation and random elements, Astrologian can be a difficult class to start out with,
                    but if you put the time in, it can be one of the best classes to main.</p>

                <img src="../../../assets/images/Classes/Healer/Sage.png" alt="Sage">
                <h3>Sage</h3>
                <p>Sage is a shild healer as well as a battle healer. The mindset of sage is, killing the boss faster is a 
                    form of mitigation. This class offers shields to its allies. Though it does have healing spells, its main source 
                    of healing is from a spell that converts damage it does into healing for its designated partner. If you are 
                    looking into healing but still like big damage, this is the healer for you.</p>

                <h3>Scholar</h3>
                <p>Have you ever thought that no matter how much healing you yourself does, your team mates are still taking too much damage.
                    Thats where this class comes in. Scholar is a healer that has a summon who can heal in its place. This allows the scholar
                    to do damage when it needs to but also double up on healing for when the team needs it. This class is great for those who
                    are just getting into healing and need a little extra help.</p>

                <h3>White Mage</h3>
                <p>White Mage is the classic no damgage only healing class. It has the largest healing output of all the healers and is the 
                    easiest to learn. This healer is perfect for raids where you need to keep the team alive and dont have time to do damage.
                    If you are looking for a simple healer that can keep the team alive, this is the healer for you.
